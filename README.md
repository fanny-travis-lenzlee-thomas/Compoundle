# Overview

This application offers an interactive experience where users can sign up to save their scores, or start playing immediately. Rearrange the words on the screen to form compound words or phrases with neighboring words (e.g., "Big Bird Seed" becomes Big Bird, Bird Seed). Verify your answers with the check button, and correct placements are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones are in red. Fill in blank spaces with the appropriate words for a seamless gaming experience. Click the hint button and reveal one letter of the hidden word per guess.
