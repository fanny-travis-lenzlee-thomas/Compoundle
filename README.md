# Rearranger
Bootcamp Project 2: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge

## MVC Challenge: Rearranger
In this project, our team was asked to design and build an Interactive Full-Stack App using the MVC paradigm, create our own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database. We were also asked to deploy our full-stack web application to Heroku.
